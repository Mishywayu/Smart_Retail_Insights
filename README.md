# Smart Retail Insights

## Project Overview

Smart Retail Insights is a data science project aimed at analyzing customer purchasing behavior using transactional data from an online retail store. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights that can help businesses make data-driven decisions to optimize sales and customer engagement.

## Dataset

The dataset I used for this project is **online_retail.csv**, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It contains transactional data of an e-commerce store, including details such as invoice numbers, product descriptions, customer IDs, and purchase dates.
